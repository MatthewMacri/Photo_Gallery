# Photo Gallery Project

## Project Overview
This is a simple photo gallery project, which is structured as follows:

### Main Components:
- **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the gallery.
- **style.css**: A CSS file that provides the styling for the photo gallery.
- **Assets**: A folder containing the images and other resources used in the gallery.
- **.git**: A hidden folder containing version control information for the project.
- **.vscode**: A hidden folder containing project-specific settings for Visual Studio Code.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the photo gallery.
3. Customize the `style.css` file to change the appearance of the gallery as needed.
4. Add or modify images in the `Assets` folder to update the gallery content.

### Notes:
- Ensure that the assets in the `Assets` folder are properly referenced in `index.html` to display the gallery correctly.
